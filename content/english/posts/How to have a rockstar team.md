# How to have /and keep/ a rock star development team



Let's face it - managing a team of developers is hard. Developers are expensive, picky, and some even go to the extent to call them lazy.  In the end though, developers are people, and usually have their reasons for everything.  There are a trillion reasons why a team is performing poorly. Today I'm going to shine some light on one topic that many businesses skimp on, or miss entirely, and that is **Company culture.**

Company culture is something that usually forms organically in a team, but in order to keep everything nice and smooth, you really want to steer it in the right direction, in order not to shoot yourself in the business.

Here are 7 advices  on how you can build a happy, productive team by managing the culture:

### 1. Sharing mentality
As a rather famous bunch of bears said, "Sharing is caring"! In the IT world, this usually boils down to sharing knowledge freely, quickly, and easily. In practice, this means that you have to strive for spreading knowledge in every direction. New requirements, technical breakthroughs, lessons learned during  development - you'd want to push these across the team as soon as possible. Having more knowledge in the team means less surprises, less frustration, and increased productivity.

### 2. No as*hole policy
We all know the myth of the rock star developer. The lone wolf that swoops in and does 100x the work. The Dr. House, who is always grumpy and arrogant, but saves the day. In practice, if you have just one toxic person in your team, that brings down the whole team morale, FAST. The toxicity spreads in mere months, and even if you catch the issue at some point, and part ways with this person (implying he's just one), he may have already created a feedback loop that perseveres, and is now a part of company culture. The damage transfers to new hires, and it usually results in low retention rate, low productivity, and low overall engagement. 

### 3. Us > Me
This is a tricky one to pull-off, but can really create wonders for your company. In order to build a high-functioning team, there should be a common understanding that every person is part of something bigger, and that they have each other's backs. This is the only way in which everybody knows that the team is something bigger than the sum of every individual. 

### 4. Focus on growth
If possible, try to instill a dislike for mediocrity. Try to push people just a bit outside of their comfort zone each day. Get some targets in place, set metrics for them, and shoot. What you want is steady, sustainable, **repeatable** growth. Meaning, the last thing you want is people
who are on the verge of burnout. So, make sure that people are growing steadily as people, and as professionals, and celebrate the small wins along the way. 

### 5. Default to transparency
Whenever possible, keep your team in the loop. Even if you think they don't care, or you think it's irrelevant. Keep your decision making process open, and post regular updates on how everything is going. In good and in bad times. 

There's a common (mis)understanding that employees need the bare minimum of information to get their job done - that everything else is noise, and imparts productivity. In reality, this is the main cause of rumors, and toxic work environments. Faced with lack of information, people start speculating, and they come to conclusions that work in their own minds. And if they don't like the conclusions, they leave your company. Simple as that. 

The best way to prevent this from happening, is to keep things grounded, and out in the open. Yes you might lose some people, but the majority will appreciate the honesty. If you're really worried that the information will impact their productivity, you can always keep it asynchronous, and present it in the  form of an internal company newsletter. In this way, everybody can decide for themselves whether the information is relevant to them, and
when to read it. 

### 6.  Keep in touch with the team's pulse

An ideal way to do this is to perform regular 1 on 1 meetings with your team. You will be amazed at how much insight you can gain by having a 15 minute long conversation with each team member. Developers especially are a shy bunch, so this form of communication would give you a really great perspective of your team. What you want to do during this meeting is indicate how things have changed from your last meeting, were the changes beneficial, and what would you want to do or change until your next such meeting. Have a list of points you'd want to discuss, but also keep the conversation going, so as not to miss nuggets of useful info. 

### 7. Have a feedback loop. Keep it balanced.

Having 1 on 1's is great, but closing the feedback loop is equally important. In order to fully utilize the team voice, you need to hear and understand them loud and clear. One way to do this is to have a clear overall plan for getting feedback. One such way is a [360 review ](https://www.thebalancecareers.com/what-is-a-360-review-1917541).

> *The 360 review is a [professional feedback opportunity](https://www.thebalancecareers.com/360-degree-feedback-information-1917537) that enables a group of coworkers to provide feedback about a fellow employee’s performance. The feedback was traditionally asked for by the manager to whom the employee reported.*

Essentially, it is a way to have a clear metric on an employee's performance, and a great way for them to validate themselves. A great side effect is that managers also pass through the review, so one can identify problem areas on the managerial layer in their organization quickly. A key advice here is to focus equally on people's strengths and weaknesses. The review process is neither a bashing contest, neither an ego booster. The review is a tool for people to get better, and to get actionable insights. It also has to be just a part of a bigger feedback loop, not a one-stop-shop.

### 7. We're on a mission!

> *“Customers will never love a company until the employees love it first.”*
> – Simon Sinek, author, Start with Why

Everybody is trying to get their team more involved, and enthusiastic about their work. What you want to do is make it easier for your team to identify with their work(place). THE most basic thing you could do is to give a meaningful answer to the question "**How are we helping people?**".  Many businesses don't stop to outline the purpose of their business to their team. The business's mission, from your team's perspective, isn't earning more profits, or taking a bigger market share. When you boil it down it pays their salary, it takes up 8 hours of their lives every day, and that's mostly it. So getting your team on board the idea that they're making people's lives better actually gives them two huge benefits:

1. They are a part of something bigger than themselves,
2. It gets them into the mindset that they're making a difference in this world.

Usually businesses help people through their products, but there's usually more to it. Never underestimate the emotional side to it. People like to identify with products, and if your own team internalizes the idea that they are shaping something groundbreaking, this will lead to amazing things.
