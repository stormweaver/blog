Every once in a while, somebody comes along and starts complaining about working with millennials in their team. 

> *Millennials are lazy!*

> *Millennials are entitled!*

> *Millennials aren't engaged!*

And oftentimes, they are right from their tower. Today we're going 
to assess both parties, and outline some ways to make the most of the situation.



## Important numbers and backstory
    
In order to paint a clear picture of the target demographic, we have to first see where they're coming from:

> Millenials are the generation born in the '80s, '90s and some push it as far as the early '00s. 
> Since 2016, they represent the largest percentage of the workforce (54%).

> **The first digital natives.** 
> They are the first generation that either grew up with the Internet, or had a smart device from early age.  Gallup found that 91% of millennials owned smartphones in 2013, compared with 83% of older generations. 

> **Crisis and debt.**
> In 2014, total outstanding student debt reached nearly $1.2 trillion dollars,
> according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Total student loan
> balances have tripled since 2004 and are the second-largest category of
> borrowing after mortgages. 

> **Disloyal.**
>
> Half of millennials — compared with 60% of non-millennials — strongly agree that they plan to be working at their company one year from now.

As disheartening and frustrating as these may seem, there is sound reasoning behind how this whole generation came up this way. 

You see, their parents - coined "baby boomers" in the US - followed a keen stance on bringing a healthy sense of self-esteem in their children, from a really young age. And they did. 

The kids had participatory trophies, which **weren't tied** with any real accomplishments. They **were** told they could do everything they set their minds upon. That the world was their oyster, ready for the taking. They **were** told that education was critical to their success in life - that it was **all they needed** to land a successful job. They **were** told that they're special, and they believed.

This coincided with the digital revolution, which gave rise to a constantly connected bunch of youths. Peers became much more important, and self-image started to revolve much more around how you're perceived, and not by how much you've actually achieved. The quick dopamine rush of likes, followers, comments and overall digital appearance made them more focused on quick wins, "viral" popularity overnight, which usually, for them, translates to success.

To top the above situation, this is the generation that grew up during the financial crisis of 2008, and were brought into adulthood under its sign, and after its aftermath. Many millennials had just graduated high school or college,  and entering a turbulent job market has taught them to adapt quickly, and survive. 

In short, if we have to paint a characteristic of the millennial, we have a person who is coming from a very optimistic upbringing, thrives online, and has had a severe disillusionment when faced with the transition into the market and adulthood.



## What has been done until now?

Managers and CEOs alike are very aware that the labour force is shifting, and there have been numerous research on what the generation wants from their employers. Terms like "engagement", "impact", "work-life balance" had surfaced, but no matter how many ping-pong tables, free lunches, team buildings and all sorts of motivational approaches have been tested, the millennials are still unhappy.

## So what the f do they want?

Let's try to visualize a millennial-business translator for a change, and start from there. Here are some examples:

What they say: ***"We want more impact!"***

What they mean: ***"We don't have much influence over the workplace dynamics, or freedom on how to do our jobs."***

What the business thinks: ***"You've been here for 3 months, what the f do you want impact over!?"***

What's happening is, this is a bunch of people who are used to fast action-reaction cycles. And to choice, and to instant gratification, and fast feedback. They expect everything to happen fast. When they realize that climbing a hierarchy takes an immense amount of effort and skills, and not a lot of hand-holding, they are much more inclined to just give up.  Voicing their confusion usually comes through as moaning, or complaining.

What they actually need and want is a structured, transparent action plan that they could follow. Of course, it should grant them enough freedom to actually feel non-constricting. This, and formalized input from their supervisor. 

### How does this help my business?

Well, this shouldn't come as a surprise, but you should already have these in place, no matter the generation. If you have rigid hierarchy in place, you probably already have fixed processes, and pipelines in your organization. Having them written down, and easily accessible would instill a sense of clarity in any employee reading this document. They would know exactly what is expected of them, and how to climb the organizational ladder. This, in turn, would lead to more engagement. 

As we noticed above, these people are [netizens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netizen). They're used to being connected, to value other people's opinion (even when it's not in their best interest), and are natural team players. Dialog is what they understand inherently.What you could do, is utilize this characteristic, and start a dialog on what you want your business to achieve, and get them more involved on how to get there. Which leads us to the next translation:

---

What they say: ***"We want a purpose!"***

What they mean: ***"We're brought up believing that we can change the world. We aren't changing the world, and we feel bad about it."***

What the business thinks: ***"Your job is to do X, we have profits and shareholders and milestones to think about, focus!"***

See, pretty much everyone want a bigger paycheck. Maybe a corner office, maybe a fat fancy title. But millennials are maybe the first ones who would turn down a bigger salary, if they believe that they're changing the world in some way, or making people's lives better. And they want this to be tangible, ***to feel good, to get their dopamine rush.*** So let them. There are a plethora of ways to change the world in small ways, no matter your industry. And it's always in your best interest, because usually your happy employees are your best advocates and  brand evangelists. 

You're harming the environment (in)directly? Plant some trees!
You're in marketing? Focus a brand campaign into helping a community!
Banking? Let your employees volunteer for a few hours every month!
IT/Software development? Write some open source, or invest in open source!
Retail? Help the environment! Recycle! Position yourself as nature-friendly!

There's always a way to do something that just feels nice, and easily doable.

### Okay, but again, how does this help my business?

Well, don't forget that the millennials who are employees in your organizations, are obviously your clients outside of it. Their peers and friends have the same tendencies, tastes and characteristics. If you hear their voice from inside the company, and follow it, there will be many more outside of it, who will love to identify with your brand.

Okay enough with the translator. Let's focus on some other misalignments between gen Y expectations and reality:

### Are you my ...Boss? Coach? Friend? Mentor?

Another hit that the millennial's reality takes is the power dynamic in the workplace. They are the generation that mostly jumbles professional life with personal life - unlike baby boomers who put a clear fence between the two. As a consequence, the former have mixed expectations from their direct supervisor. Expectations include a gentler approach, but insist on transparency and honesty. They value authenticity and integrity in their leaders. 

For you, this means that giving direct orders and expecting a blindfolded execution without any questions won't work anymore (or will work for a really short while, until you're handed a resignation letter). What would work, is a laser focused vision for the company and its goals, and how every department contributes to this vision. From then on, give advice on how they could achieve these goals, set clear metrics for whether they're achieved or not, and have faith in your teams. But by all means, enter a clear measurable workflow, and keep a short feedback loop across all departments. You would also be wise to set clear boundaries between professional and personal, as that might be a grey area currently. 



### In conclusion:

The emerging workforce of today is coming from a tough place, and has to deal with a turbulent job market that doesn't really understand it. It will be a hard transition, but with open channels for dialog, and some change, both sides can benefit immensely.
